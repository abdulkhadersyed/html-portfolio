        <h1>The Best Movies According to Me</h1>
        <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>The Shawshank Redemption (1994)</h3>
        <p>I don't know why but I like this movie alot</p>
        <h3>Sontham (2002)</h3>
        <p>I liked the movie for it comedic angle and a character played by Mr. Sunil was the soul to the movie. I watch it's comedy scenes whenever I feel low and wanted some laugh and it makes me laugh everytime I watch it.</p>

        <h3>RRR (2022)</h3>
        <p>I know it's a common pick but I really liked this movie alot. TBH, I never really watch Mr. Rajamouli's movies more than once, but this movie is worth watching more than once. The cinematography, the choreography, the music numbers, everything is absolutely perfect. I highly recommend you to watch the movie and it's totally worth the watch.</p>
        <p>I'm attaching the link to the movie's IMDb link. Give it a look</p>
